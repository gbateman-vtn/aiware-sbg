Two approaches to processing assets are outlined in this repository.

Workflow 1 is to use a single call that runs an Automate Studio engine to kick off 5 cognitive processes.

Workflow 2 enables the API user to make discrete calls that both create a TDO and process media with a single engine.

In order to run Text engines you must pass the url from the Transcription engine getAssets call or provde a url to a txt file.
